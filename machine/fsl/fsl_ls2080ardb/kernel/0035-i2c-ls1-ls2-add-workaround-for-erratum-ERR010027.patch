Subject: [PATCH 035/245] i2c: ls1/ls2: add workaround for erratum ERR010027

ERR010027/ERR008951: Attempting a start cycle while the
bus is busy may generate a short clock pulse.

Software must ensure that the I2C BUS is idle by checking the
bus busy before switching to master mode and attempting a Start
cycle.
